# Internet Speedtest with Docker

## Modified from https://github.com/sthuber90/docker-speedtest ARM -> x86_64

![docker-publish](https://github.com/sthuber90/docker-speedtest/workflows/docker-publish/badge.svg)

> Run [Ookla's speedtest CLI](https://www.speedtest.net/de/apps/cli) to regularly test your local internet connection 
> from a [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) x86_64 compatible container.
> The results of the speed test are intended to be forwarded to an [InfluxDB](https://docs.influxdata.com/) and visualized
> in a [Chronograf](https://docs.influxdata.com/chronograf) dashboard.

This project is inspired and based on [thinkonezero/docker-speedtest](https://gitlab.com/phikai/docker-speedtest).
Thank you very much for the work you put in, paving the way for this project.

## Prerequisites
* Docker
* x86_64 arch

## Usage
![Dashboard](docs/img/dashboard.png)

1. `git clone git@github.com:drakor007/docker-speedtest.git`
2. `docker-compose up -d`
3. Open Chronograf http://localhost:8888
4. Import dashboard
5. Now, you can access the dashboard under http://localhost:8888/sources/0/dashboards/1

### Chronograf
Visualizes the stored data in a dashboard.

| Variables | Default | Function |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| INFLUXDB_URL| http://influxdb:8086 | URL to query InfluxDB. Port in URL must match the port of the InfluxDB container. |

For further information refer to the [official image](https://hub.docker.com/_/chronograf)

### InfluxDB
Stores the speed test data:
* download speed (Mbit/s), 
* upload speed (Mbit/s),
* latency (ms), 
* jitter (ms), 
* packet loss (%)

By default, the data is stored for 7 days. If you want to change it, you have to change the default retention policy through 
the Chronograf UI.

| Variables | Default | Function |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| INFLUXDB_DB| speedtest | Database table to store the speed test results in. MUST be the same table name provided to the SpeedTest container. |

Read the [official docs](https://hub.docker.com/_/influxdb) for further environment variables available

### Speedtest
Image is based on Alpine Linux and available via [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/sthuber90/speedtest/) as `sthuber90/speedtest`.

It gets built through [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) from [this Dockerfile](Dockerfile).

If, for whatever reason, the speed test fails or gets aborted - in case there has been no response received within 5 minutes -
the script will classify that as "no internet connection is available". In this case, the script will store 0 Mbit/s for 
the download and upload speed and 100% packet loss in the InfluxDB. For latency and jitter no values get written to the InfluxDB in this case.

| Variables | Default | Function |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| INFLUXDB_DB| speedtest | Database table to store the speed test results in. MUST be the same table name provided to the InfluxDB container. |
| TEST_INTERVAL | 900 | Time in seconds until the speed test script is run again. Default is 15 minutes. May not be smaller than 5 minutes. |

or streams taking place within your network during a test.
